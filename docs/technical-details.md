# Core Claims Technical Details

## Data Model

Cosmos DB with Multiple Containers for logically separated data.

### Container: Member

**Entities**: Member, Coverage, ClaimHeader  
**Partition Key**: `memberId`  

#### Entity: Member

## Data Ingestion

### Seeding

In order to demonstrate Cosmos DB's ability to handle extremely large data-sets we'll be pre-loading the system with a large volume of records.

A Synapse script will be used to bulk insert the initial seed data into the CosmosDB containers. The source of this initial data will vary based on the entity type.

### Streaming data

In order to simulate continuous claims being filed, a Publisher app will be created. This will be a simple Console/Function app that will be responsible for using Faker to generate new claims, and push them to the `IncomingClaim` EventHub topic.

## Web API

The Web API application will be main entry point for users, exposing a number of endpoints for use in testing and the UI.

## Worker Service

This background service hosts the Azure Cosmos DB change feed processor and EventHub processor.

### Application Flow

For the purposes of this demo we're going to limit the scope of the process to highlight a few specific details. We'll be tracking the state of a claim through its life-cycle, from creation, through to completion.

#### 1. Creation

> [!trigger] Endpoint: CreateClaim  
> **Trigger**: EventHub Topic: `IncomingClaim`  
> **Request**: ClaimDetail  
> 
> Event hub trigger that will take details of the claim including
> - claimId from upstream **(required)**
> - Member claim belongs to (Optional)
> - Provider (ie: Medical Provider)
> - Payer (ie: Insurance Provider)
> - Line Items for the claim (1+ rows with cost/details)
> - if `claimStatus` == `Resubmitted` treat it as an update rather than rejecting as a duplicate
> 
> Some simple validation should be done to ensure the claim is not a duplicate of an existing claim. Validation is checking for existing claim with claimId (when eventType is create), duplicate should return an Error, and publish an Event to `RejectedClaims` topic in EventHub.

A claim is first created via the `CreateClaim` endpoint. This could be via an event from the EventHub, or via an HTTP Post action. This should create a Claim. A Claim consists of 2 documents in a container.

- ClaimHeader
- ClaimDetail

The Claim Detail contains the bulk of the information about the claim, including Member and Payer, as well as the line items on the claim. The ClaimDetail should almost never be updated, instead it will be replaced with newer version. The ClaimHeader is a simplified view of the claim, containing:

- a reference to the latest version of the ClaimDetail
- a subset of the properties on the detail
- an aggregate of the total line items
- the status of the *current* ClaimDetail
- Optional flag "resubmitted" to indicate it's an update

Creating a claim will create both of these documents, and set their state to `Initial`

#### 2. Auto-Adjudication/Assignment

> [!trigger] Endpoint: AssignClaimAdjudicator  
> **Trigger**: Change Feed/ClaimUpdated, LeasePrefix: `ReviewClaim`
> 
> Will be triggered when a claim is created in the `Initial` state **OR** claim is `Resubmitted`, if the business logic decides it needs manual adjudication, it will have an adjudicator assigned, and it's status will be set to `Assigned`.
> If the logic decides it can be auto-processed, it will be processed according to some simple business logic that we will define. Automatically approved/declined Claims will be updated to either `Complete` or `Declined` based on these rules.

When a claim enters the system, some rules will be reviewed to decide if the system can automatically adjudicate the Claim, or if it must be manually reviewed. If the claim can be automatically adjudicated this step will apply any appropriate actions to the Claim, approving or declining it. If it doesn't meet the criteria for automatic adjudication it will be assigned to an adjudicator and flagged for manual review.

Rules for Auto-adjudication
- If the Claim has no Member assigned: Set status to `Pending`, do nothing else, expect this will be Resubmitted with 
- If the Member the does not have active coverage for the date of the claim: Set to `Denied`
- Calculate total $ of claim, if < $200 set `Approved`, otherwise `Assigned` and assign adjudicator to the Claim
  - threshold should be configurable, set initial value based on producers example claims, targeting ~0.001% or less to be flagged manual

Rules when `Resubmitted`:
- This should esentially restart the workflow **regardless of where it currently is**
- We can leave it assigned to the existing Adjudicator if one has already been assigned

#### 3. Acknowledgement
Once a claim has been assigned for **manual** adjudication, the adjudicator must acknowledge the claim. To support this, two endpoints will be build

> [!api] Endpoint: GetAssignedClaims  
> **GET** /adjudicator/{adjudicator}/claims  
> **Response**: 200 (OK), `PagedResult<ClaimHeader>`  
> 
> API that will list all claims assigned to the current adjudicator.
>
> Store redundant ClaimHeader data with Adjudicator as Partition Key to allow for improved query, maintained by change feed  

> [!api] Endpoint: AcknowledgeClaim  
> **POST** /claims/{claimId}/acknowledge  
> **Request**: tbc, maybe just empty post?  
> **Response**: 200 (OK) with `ClaimHeader`, or 204 (NoContent) or 4XX  
>  
>  API that will take a claimId and update the status of the claim to `Acknowledged`

#### 4. Review

> [!api] Endpoint: UpdateAdjudication  
> **POST** /claims/{claimId}  
> **Request**: Partial ClaimDetail model (including line-items)  
> **Response**: 200 (OK) with `ClaimHeader`, or 204 (NoContent) or 4XX  
>
> Adjudicator can include status in this request
> - **Denied**: Close claim as Denied
> - **Proposed**: Can be auto approved based on rules below
>  
> Small change: (+/- $500 difference between initial claim and proposed change), set status to Complete  
> Large Change: Manual Approve, claim will be reassigned to a manager with "ApprovalRequired" status

An adjudicator will then review the claim, potentially updating some of the details, and deciding weather to accept or reject the claim.

Some modifications will require adjudicators with specific permissions to approve. For the purposes of this demo application we will be implementing two roles, `Manager` and `Adjudicator`. Adjudicators will be able to approve claims if their modifications are less than $200, if their modifications are more than this number the Claim will be reassigned to an adjudicator with the `Manager` role. Adjudicator assignments will be random, but should be built in a way that this logic can easily be customized for use in a real world scenario.

#### 5. Post-Review
Once a ClaimHeader gets the `Complete` or `Denied` status assigned, an event will be published to a topic in the EventHub. While nothing will be listening for the event in this implementation, it's expected that an external payment system could listen for this event and handle payment processing in a real world scenario.

> [!trigger] Endpoint: ClaimComplete  
> **Trigger**: Change Feed/ClaimUpdated, LeasePrefix: `ClaimComplete`
> 
> When a claim is updated in the Claims container, and it's Status is set to `Complete` or `Denied` publish a message to the appropriate EventHub topic (`ClaimApproved`, `ClaimDenied`). Message should include the whole of the latest ClaimDetail entity (including the line items).
> 
> In order to demonstrate the change-feed's usefulness in keeping running counts, in additional to publishing messages to EventHub, for **approved** claims, we will update the associated Member record, incrementing the `approved.count` number by 1, and `approved.total` by the total of the approved claim. 

### Supporting Endpoints
> [!api] Endpoint: GetClaim  
> **GET** /claim/{claimId}  
> **Response**: 200 (OK) with `ClaimDetail`, or 4XX
> 
> Return a claim based on it's claimId from Cosmos

> [!api] Endpoint: GetClaimHistory  
> **GET** /claim/{claimId}/history  
> **Response**: 200 (OK), or 4XX
> 
> Return a claim and All Historic ClaimDetail based on it's claimId from Cosmos
> Suggested response
> ```json
> {
>   header: { /* ClaimHeader record */ },
>   history: [
>      /* All ClaimDetail records sorted by timestamp */ 
>   ]
> }
> ```


> [!api] Endpoint: ListProviders  
> **GET** /providers  
> **Response**: 200 (OK) with `PagedResult<Provider>`, or 4XX  
> 
> Return a list of Providers from Cosmos

> [!api] Endpoint: ListPayers  
> **GET** /payers  
> **Response**: 200 (OK) with `PagedResult<Payer>`, or 4XX  
> 
> Return a list of Payers from Cosmos

> [!api] Endpoint: ListMemberClaims  
> **GET** /member/{memberId}/claims  
> **Response**: 200 (OK) with `PagedResult<ClaimHeader>`  
> **Optional Parameters**: `startDate`, `endDate`: should filter query for claims filed between these dates
> 
> Return a list claims for a specific member, and their status.
> Writing a claim will trigger a change feed that will write a redundant version of the ClaimHeader with memberId as the partition key
> 
> **Future State**: Prefer Continuation Tokens for paging for best performance  
> **Future State**: Additional filters (ie: Total)

> [!view] View: Aggregate Status Counts  
> In order to provide more complex query functionality in a performant manor, the Claims container will need to be exposed as a Synapse view. The container will need to be created with this in mind to ensure compatibility with Synapse.
>  
> **Stretch Goal:** For the scope of this release we will deprioritize the Synapse integration. If time allows we should aim to expose this, and provide a few example queries. But prioritizing the other functionality is first priority.

### Change feed Endpoints

> [!trigger] Endpoint: ClaimUpdated  
> **Trigger**: Change Feed/ClaimUpdated, LeasePrefix: `PropigateClaimHeader`  
> 
> When a claim is updated in the Claims container, the following should happen:
> - If the claim has a member: A redundant copy of the claim header should be stored in the member container allowing for efficient query of "Claims by MemberId"
> - If the claim has an adjudicator assigned: A redundant copy of the claim header should be stored in the adjudicator container allowing for efficient query of "Claims by Adjudicator"

| EventHub/Topic     | `AdjudicatorChanged`            | Topic where the adjudicator for a claim was changed, such as when a manager is assigned because they need to approve a proposal. Downstream, the EventHub processor uses the claim header data to delete the previous adjudicator's claim header record. This way, there are no duplicated records between two adjudicators.  |
